<p>During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people, less than
     6 inches (15 cm) tall, who are inhabitants of the island country of Lilliput. After giving assurances of his good behaviour, he is
      given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the Lilliput Royal Court. He is also given permission by the King of 
      Lilliput to go around the city on condition that he must not hurt their subjects.

    At first, the Lilliputians are hospitable to Gulliver, but they are also wary of the threat that his size poses to them. The 
    Lilliputians reveal themselves to be a people who put great emphasis on trivial matters. For example, which end of an egg a person 
    cracks becomes the basis of a deep political rift within that nation. They are a people who revel in displays of authority and 
    performances of power. Gulliver assists the Lilliputians to subdue their neighbours the Blefuscudians by stealing their fleet. 
    However, he refuses to reduce the island nation of Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the King and the royal court.
    
    Gulliver is charged with treason for, among other crimes, urinating in the capital though he was putting out a fire. He is
     convicted and sentenced to be blinded. With the assistance of a kind friend, "a considerable person at court", he escapes 
     to Blefuscu. Here, he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship, which safely 
     takes him back home.</p>
